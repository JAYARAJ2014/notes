# SOLID Principles

## Single Responsibility Principle - SRP

Every software component should have only one responsibility.
Every software component should have only one "reason to change". (More reasons to change will increase frequency of changes and probability of bugs)

A component can be a module, class or method.
Aim for higher cohesion between all methods of a class helps moving towards SRP

### Cohesion

- Degree to which various parts of a software components are related.

### Coupling

- Level of interdependency between components

SRP => Higher Cohesion + Lose Coupling
